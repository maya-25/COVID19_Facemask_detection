# COVID19_Facemask_detection
It will tell whether the person wearing mask or not in order to protect nose and mouth from Corona virus
Here libraries used: 
1.Tensorflow
2.scikit-learn
3.numpy
4.Matplotlib
5.imutils for video streaming and for setting up the camera frame.
6.deploy.prototxt,res_ssd_300Dim - These two files required for setting the camera and detecting the face.


Here MobileNetV2(weights="imagenet") transfer learning is used for traning the model initially.
